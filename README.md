## Gravity force on the rocket
The simulator applies the standard newtonian gravity formulation.
Assuming we are only interested in the force acting on the rocket, and that the center of the Earth is in the origin, the gravitational force is:
$$\mathbf{F}_{g} = \frac{G m M_e }{\|\mathbf{r}\|^3}\mathbf{r}$$
Where:
  - G : gravity constant
  - m : mass of the rocket
  - M_e : mass of Earth
  - **r** : position vector of the Rocket w.r.t. the origin
